# Turtle Crossing Road

This is a fun and challenging game developed using Python's Turtle graphics library. The objective is to guide a brave turtle safely across a busy road filled with oncoming cars. The goal is to reach the other side without getting hit, increasing the level with each successful crossing.

# Features:

* Upward movement only: The turtle can only move vertically using the Up arrow key. This adds a strategic element to dodging cars.
* Scoreboard: Keep track of your progress by viewing your current level.
* Game Over: If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends.

# Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Turtle graphics library (included with Python)

# Gameplay Controls:

Use the Up arrow key to move the turtle upward.

# Tips:

Time your movements carefully to avoid oncoming cars. Develop a strategy to navigate through increasingly challenging traffic as your level increases.

# Project Structure:

(Assuming you have separate files for the player, car, and scoreboard)

* main.py: The main script that initializes the game window, sets up the game elements, and handles the game loop.
* player.py: Defines the player's turtle character, including its movement functions.
* car.py: Manages the creation and movement of cars on the road.
* scoreboard.py: Tracks the player's level and displays it on the screen.

# How to run the game:

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Open a terminal in the directory containing the game script (main.py)
3. Run the script using the command `python main.py` 

# Customization

Feel free to modify the code to adjust game difficulty (car speed, number of cars), add different levels, or enhance the graphics.
